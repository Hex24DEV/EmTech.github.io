            <h2>DAY 1: The Thrilling Kickoff</h2>
            <p>
                The start of Intramurals Week was bursting with excitement! The day began with a grand parade, where we proudly waved our banners and flags, representing our section and team with enthusiasm. 
                The opening ceremony was a spectacle, introducing us to the much-anticipated Mr. and Ms. Intramurals and the talented players set to compete. 
                As the games commenced, my friends and I eagerly watched the basketball match. Though our team didn't win, the experience left us energized and eager for the days ahead!

            <h2>DAY 2: Close Matches and Team Spirit</h2>
            <p>
                My day started in a rush! I was assign to play for my strands badminton singles but I didn't know the schedule yet so when I got the schedule it was 8:30 AM and I thought it was 10 AM because that was the time mentioned at the given schedule of our adviser, 
		so I rushed to school and barely catched my queue time but I managed to catch it so I played the match. 
		It was a good match but luck wasn't on my side so I lost the game and got only 3rd place.

            <h2>DAY 3: The Faculty Showdown & Championship Thrill</h2>
            <p>
                This was one of the most anticipated days, the Faculty Exhibition Game! Ever since Grade 11, I had looked forward to seeing our teachers step onto the court, not as educators but as spirited players. 
                It was refreshing to watch them enjoy, laugh, and forget about their workload for a while. But the real thrill? It was championship day! With the final matches and the grand coronation of Mr. and Ms. Intramurals, the intensity was at an all-time high. 
                Even though nerves ran wild, we all remembered that the heart of the event was about having fun. And that, we definitely did!
