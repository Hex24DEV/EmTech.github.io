    <h1>🏠 Final Exam Project: Arduino Home Alarm System</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="container">
    <p>As our finals approached in Empowerment Technologies, we were given a challenging and exciting task — to create a working <strong>Home Alarm System</strong> using <strong>Arduino and Tinkercad</strong>! This project was not just about circuits and code; it was about bringing our problem-solving and creativity into the real world of electronics and automation.</p>

    <h2>🔧 The Project: A Functional Home Alarm</h2>
    <p>Our main objective was to build a circuit that could detect objects (intruders!) and provide visual and audio alerts. We used components like an <strong>ultrasonic sensor</strong>, an <strong>LCD display</strong>, and a <strong>buzzer</strong>. The idea was to simulate how home alarm systems work — detecting motion or proximity and instantly alerting the user.</p>

    <p>We worked hard to get the components wired correctly in Tinkercad. It was a great moment when our ultrasonic sensor started detecting objects, and the buzzer would sound based on the proximity!</p>

    <h2>👩‍💻 The Experience</h2>
    <p>One of the highlights was figuring out how to use the <strong>LCD screen</strong> to show messages like <em>"Proximity Alert!"</em> and the actual distance. That moment when everything finally worked felt like magic — except it was <strong>code + teamwork + perseverance</strong>!</p>

    <h2>💡 What We Learned</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How ultrasonic sensors can measure distance accurately.</li>
      <li>Using the Arduino IDE to write logic for alert systems.</li>
      <li>Displaying outputs to LCD and triggering a buzzer when danger is near.</li>
      <li>Collaborating as a team to debug, test, and improve the system.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This was more than just a final project — it was a real taste of what engineers and inventors do. It made us appreciate how technology can be applied to improve safety and security in our homes.</p>

    <h2>🎓 Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>Looking back, our Home Alarm System project helped us grow not just technically but also in how we collaborate and solve real-life problems. We may have started as students, but by the end of this project, we truly felt like <strong>tech innovators</strong>.</p>
    <p>Who knows — the next big invention might just come from a classroom like ours! 💡🤖</p>
