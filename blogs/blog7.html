        <h1>Our Practical Examination in Empowerment Technologies: A Journey of Learning and Innovation</h1>
        <p>Technology continues to shape the way we live, work, and learn, and our recent practical examination in Empowerment Technologies proved just that. This experience not only tested our technical skills but also challenged our creativity, problem-solving abilities, and teamwork.</p>
        
        <h2>The Task at Hand</h2>
        <p>For our practical examination, we were tasked with designing and implementing a <span class="highlight">Proximity-Based Parking Assistance System</span> using <span class="highlight">Arduino and Tinkercad</span>. The goal was to assist drivers in parking by using sensors and visual/audio alerts.</p>

        <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>7-9 cm:</strong> RGB LED Green (Safe)</li>
            <li><strong>4-6 cm:</strong> RGB LED Yellow (Caution)</li>
            <li><strong>1-3 cm:</strong> RGB LED Red + Piezo Buzzer rapid beep (Danger)</li>
            <li>The <span class="highlight">7-segment display</span> showed the remaining distance in centimeters.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Our Approach and Execution</h2>
        <p>We started by carefully setting up the circuit, ensuring all components were correctly placed. The <span class="highlight">ultrasonic sensor</span> played a crucial role in detecting obstacles, while the <span class="highlight">RGB LED and piezo buzzer</span> provided immediate feedback to the driver.</p>

        <h2>Overcoming Challenges</h2>
        <p>During the testing phase, we encountered some minor issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <span class="highlight">7-segment display</span> initially displayed incorrect readings, which we fixed by adjusting the code’s formatting.</li>
            <li>The <span class="highlight">buzzer timing</span> needed fine-tuning to ensure a clear and effective warning signal.</li>
            <li>The <span class="highlight">RGB LED wiring</span> required careful checking to match the programmed color outputs.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>What We Learned</h2>
        <p>This practical examination reinforced our understanding of <span class="highlight">Arduino programming, circuit design, and real-world problem-solving</span>. We gained hands-on experience in integrating multiple components into a functional system, applying logic in coding, and improving our debugging skills.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Our practical examination in Empowerment Technologies was more than just an academic requirement—it was a meaningful experience that prepared us for future challenges in <span class="highlight">embedded systems and automation</span>. By successfully developing a <span class="highlight">Proximity-Based Parking Assistance System</span>, we proved that technology can enhance everyday life, and with the right skills, we can innovate solutions to real-world problems.</p>
